# Performance Optimization Plan for EnhancedStudentRequestManager

## Current Performance Issues Identified

1. **Large dataset handling**: Component loads all requests at once
2. **Inefficient re-renders**: Parent re-renders affect child components
3. **Memory usage**: Large arrays kept in memory
4. **Network optimization**: No pagination or lazy loading
5. **Bundle size**: Large component with many imports

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Data Layer Optimization
- [ ] Implement React Query pagination with `useInfiniteQuery`
- [ ] Add server-side filtering and sorting
- [ ] Implement data virtualization with react-window
- [ ] Add request deduplication and caching

### 2. Component Architecture
- [ ] Split into smaller, focused components
- [ ] Implement React.memo for all child components
- [ ] Use React.lazy for code splitting
- [ ] Add proper key props for list items

### 3. State Management
- [ ] Move global state to React Query cache
- [ ] Implement local state colocation
- [ ] Add state persistence with localStorage
- [ ] Use useReducer for complex state

### 4. Rendering Optimization
- [ ] Implement React.memo with custom comparison
- [ ] Add useMemo for expensive calculations
- [ ] Use useCallback for stable function references
- [ ] Implement selective re-rendering

### 5. Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Code splitting with React.lazy
- [ ] Dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Tree shaking unused code
- [ ] Optimize third-party imports

### 6. Network Optimization
- [ ] Implement request batching
- [ ] Add request caching strategies
- [ ] Use service worker for offline support
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)
1. Add React.memo to all child components
2. Implement proper key props
3. Add useMemo for expensive calculations
4. Optimize bundle imports

### Phase 2: Data Optimization (2-3 days)
1. Implement pagination with React Query
2. Add server-side filtering
3. Implement data virtualization
4. Add caching strategies

### Phase 3: Architecture Refactor (3-4 days)
1. Split into smaller components
2. Implement code splitting
3. Add state management improvements
4. Optimize rendering pipeline
